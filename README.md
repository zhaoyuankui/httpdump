Parse and display http traffic from network device or pcap file. This is a go version of origin pcap-parser, thanks to gopacket project, this tool has simpler code base and is more efficient.

For original python implementation, [refer to httpcap on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/httpcap/).

# Install & Requirement
Build httpdump requires libpcap-dev and cgo enabled.
## libpcap
for ubuntu/debian:

```sh
sudo apt install libpcap-dev
```

for centos/redhat/fedora:

```sh
sudo yum install libpcap-devel
```
在CentOS下,默认的是无法安装libpcap与libpcap-devel的

需要进入/etc/yum.repos.d目录下，vim Centos-Vault.repo中

修改
```
[C6.0-base]
name=CentOS-6.0 - Base
baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/6.0/os/$basearch/
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-6
enabled=0 为1
```

for osx:

Libpcap and header files should be available in macOS already.

## Install

```sh
go get github.com/hsiafan/httpdump
```


# Usage
httpdump can read from pcap file, or capture data from network interfaces:

```
  -device string
    	Capture packet from network device. If is any, capture all interface traffics (default "any")
  -file string
    	Read from pcap file. If not set, will capture data from network device by default
  -filter-host string
    	Filter by request host, using wildcard match(*, ?)
  -filter-uri string
    	Filter by request url path, using wildcard match(*, ?)
  -force
    	Force print unknown content-type http body even if it seems not to be text content
  -ip string
    	Filter by ip, if either source or target ip is matched, the packet will be processed
  -level string
    	Output level, options are: url(only url) | header(http headers) | all(headers, and textuary http body) (default "header")
  -output string
    	Write result to file [output] instead of stdout
  -port uint
    	Filter by port, if either source or target port is matched, the packet will be processed.
  -pretty
    	Try to format and prettify json content
```

## Samples
A simple capture:

```
$ httpdump
